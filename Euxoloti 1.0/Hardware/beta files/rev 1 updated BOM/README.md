#### special note about pots
toneburst@axoloti forum (euxoloti thread):
Also, just noticed the pots are in different orientations, which means I can't use the Panasonic pots, or the pointers on the knobs will point in the wrong directions.

Might have been a good idea to make a note of that in the BOM or, preferably put all the pots the same way round, so people can use D-Shaft pots if they want to. It's not a dense board, wouldn't be difficult to orient them all like the top row, I don't think.
